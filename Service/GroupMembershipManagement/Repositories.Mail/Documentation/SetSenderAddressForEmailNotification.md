# Set sender address for email notification

1) Open the Azure Portal from the tenant where the Graph App is created in
2) Add Mail.Send Delegated Permission in `<SolutionAbbreviation>-Graph-<EnvironmentAbbreviation>` application
3) Enable 'Allow public client flows' in `<SolutionAbbreviation>-Graph-<EnvironmentAbbreviation>` application -> Authentication
4) Create a new service account:

    * This can be done by creating a new user from the tenant where the Graph App is created in
    * Make sure the user has a usage location set
    * This account will be used as the sender address for email notifications sent out by the GMM application
    * Please note username & password of this user.

5) Run [Set-SenderRecipientCredentials.ps1](/Scripts/Set-SenderRecipientCredentials.ps1) to store sender and secondary recipient information in prereqs keyvault

    * Please make sure that a prereqs keyvault exists in your environment
    * Open the script in Windows PowerShell ISE
    * Set the CC Email Address to whatever email you want to be notified at
    * Add the following lines to the the end before running the script:
        ```
        Set-SenderRecipientCredentials	-SubscriptionName "<SubscriptionName>" `
                                        -SolutionAbbreviation "<SolutionAbbreviation>" `
                                        -EnvironmentAbbreviation "<EnvironmentAbbreviation>" `
                                        -SenderUsername "<username-of-the-user-created-in-the-previous-step>" `
                                        -SenderPassword "<password-of-the-user-created-in-the-previous-step>" `
                                        -SyncCompletedCCEmailAddresses "<cc-email-address-when-sync-is-completed>" `
                                        -SyncDisabledCCEmailAddresses "<cc-email-address-when-sync-is-disabled>" `
                                        -SupportEmailAddresses "<cc email addresses for technical support>" `
                                        -Verbose
        ```
